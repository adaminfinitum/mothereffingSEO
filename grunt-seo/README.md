# Mostly this code relates to web performance optimization (WPO).

Specifically, WPO of existing sites where you have no communication with the developers (due to outsourcing, and high turnover) and where you never know what intern will end up filling your shoes at a later date.

Yeah. It was as much fun as it sounds ;-)

I was working on sites that I didn't contribute to and that others would likely work on after me so one of my main concerns was making it clear for the dumbest person that might work on the site what I had done.

Thus, files are concated in a format like this:
-styles1.css
-styles2.css
-styles3.css

becomes
-styles1-styles2-styles3.css

or at least that's the idea.

I may have included a timestamp or some other features like ...min.css (and .js) but I forget.

Use it if it's useful be be aware that the whole point is to work (with adaptations) on any site, on any CMS (or no CMS) and to be obvious for the lowest common denominator.

I can't recall how well any of these work so be forewarned.
