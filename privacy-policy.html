<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We do not sell or rent website user data.</p>
<p>We do not persistently track users.</p>
<p>In general:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We aim to follow the terms of service of the software we use on this site or to get users to the site.</li>
  <li>We are cognizant and careful with data about our visitors and users, especially personally identifiable information.</li>
  <li>If you have questions, find errors or notice inconsitencies with these statements please contact us.</li>
</ol>
<p>We do not share data with entities that we do not own, manage, employ or contract with the following exception(s):</p>
<ul>
  <li>3rd party software services we utilize (commonly: analytics, content management services, newsletter or contact form services, hosting and anti-spam providers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our server tracks users for purposes of monitoring and improving. Most of this data is collected in aggregate and generally does not identify users with specific behaviors or actions.</p>
<p>This site uses JavaScript, cookies, server logs and transparent images known as tracking beacons. Our server logs the IP address of all incoming and outgoing connections but in normal circumstances these logs are only kept for a short time.</p>
<p>Like most sites we can usually see where our visitors came from (possibly including the terms searched in search engines), what actions they took while on our site, the IP address of their internet connection, and what technology they used to browse our site or try to connect to our server.</p>
<p>Normal users of our website (users who do not try to access protected content or submit contentâ€”which may include usernames, passwords, forms or comments) will likely never be tracked individually.</p>
<p>Data is collected via 3rd party tools including Google Analytics and by our servers and traffic analysis tools.</p>
<p>This site may use analytics, re-marketing, re-targeting, and conversion tracking scripts which include demographic reporting from major providers such as Google (via AdWords and Analytics) and Facebook.</p>
<p>This site may also use tools such as call tracking and anonymous user approximation tools which attempt to guess the business connected with users that have visited our site (based on the public IP address).</p>
