# MotherEffingSEO

Named in homage to Paul Irish because the HTML5 Boilerplate really opened my eyes, at least, once I knew enough to appreciate it.

MotherEffingSEM might be more accurate as there's quite a bit of PPC related stuff here too like negative keyword lists and domains that I always exclude from display ads.

## Contents
In no particular order:

### Front End
Most of my front-end snippets are directly from or were inspired by Twitter Bootstrap and looking through the CSS of W3C.org (a few are original). Regardless, they are handy which is why they have become my defaults.

### Server Configs
An awful lot of the server stuff is straight from the HTML5 Boilerplate although some of these things are only visible there if you browse through past incarnations of the project.

Mostly these will relate to Apache although over time I might add their Nginx and other equivalents (if I can find them or get really motivated and decide to look them up).

Mostly, these are related to performance as that impacts user experience and therefore search engine marketing effectiveness.

### Sublime Text
I use Sublime Text, and not a free trial version either. I also plan on including some Sublime Text related stuff like my customizations to Emmet and the RegEx that lets me select every other line in a document, etc.

### Pay Per Click
Smart default negative keyword list and placement exclusions.

Lists of cities and states for local campaigns (remove your state from the list and add the rest as negative keywords).

### Scrapy Configs
If you can't beat 'em, join em.

Doing everything yourself, from scratch, is for the birds. Sometimes you just need to scrape existing content from the web. 

Maybe it's for competitive surveillance, maybe it's for sentiment analysis, maybe it's to download the content and edit it just enough to make it your own.

Do what you gotta do.

### Resource Lists
Many others are doing Mother Effing Awesome stuff and there will be lists, oh yes, there will be lists.
